### Docker - To Do List Project

The first learning from the **Back-End Module** at Trybe Web Development course was **Docker**.

And to make sure that we had learned all the most important command lines to create, run, stop and delete containers, we had 11 challenges to solve.

- You can find my solutions about **containers and images** in the **docker-commands** directory.
- In the **todo-app** directory you will find another three directories named **Back-end**, **Front-End** and **Tests**. Each one contains a **DockerFile** I had to compose.
