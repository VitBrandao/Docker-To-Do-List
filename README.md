### Docker - To Do List Project

The first module of **Back-End** at Trybe Web Development course we started **learning Docker**.

And to make sure that we had learned all the most important command lines to set containers and images, we had 11 challenges to solve.

- You can find all my solutions in the **docker-commands** directory.
- In the **todo-app** directory you will find another three directories named **Back-end**, **Front-End** and **Tests**. Each one contains a **DockerFile** I had to compose.
